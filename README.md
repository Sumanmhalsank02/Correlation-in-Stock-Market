## Description
---

This repository is build to analyse how the behaviour of the Stocks are correlated. The `Correlation` is perfomed on the percentage change of the stock price instead of the stock price. 

To know more about Correlation in Stock Maret, I would recommend the following link [Correlation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correlation.asp "Investopedia.com"). Do check it out for a brief understanding!!
It's extremely useful if you want to create a Diversified portfolio

This is how the output will look like!!


Pandas has provided us with a `.corr()` function:
    ``` python
    correlation = Data_CP_Perc_Change.corr()
    ```
To know more about `.corr()`, Visit [pandas.DataFrame.corr](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html)

- Have Fun!!
